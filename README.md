## Project Description

### Goal:

The "AI Image Generator" project aims to provide users with a tool for generating realistic and creative images using artificial intelligence. The application enables the creation of unique graphics that can be used in various contexts such as digital art, graphic design, or even in marketing.

### Feature Description:

- **Image Generation:** Users have the ability to generate images based on various parameters such as theme, artistic style, color palette, etc.
- **Personalization:** The option to customize details of generated images, such as contrast, brightness, or adding special effects.
- **Gallery:** Storage and browsing of previously generated images in a gallery.
- **Sharing:** The option to share generated images on social platforms or download them locally.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Image Generation:** Users can choose generation parameters, including theme, artistic style, and color palette.
- **Personalization:** Access to tools for adjusting image details, such as contrast, brightness, and applying special effects.
- **Image Gallery:** The application stores the history of generated images, with the ability to browse and reuse them.
- **Sharing:** Users can share their creations on various platforms or download them locally.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Realism of Generated Images:** Expectation that generated images will be realistic and aesthetically pleasing.
- **Generation Speed:** Implementation of efficient generation algorithms for immediate results.
- **User Interface:** User-friendly interface, easy to navigate, with intuitive customization tools.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of the Interface:

- *Home Page:* Control panel with generation options, personalization, and access to the gallery.
- *Generation Window:* Space for selecting parameters and previewing the generated image.
- *Image Gallery:* Browsing and managing previously created graphics.

### Site Map:

- *Home Page*
    - Control Panel

    - Sharing and Download Options

## System Architecture:

### Description of Data Structure:

The application stores data of generated images, including:

- **Generation Parameters:** Information about user-selected parameters.
- **Images:** Storage for generated images along with their details.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on a wrapped structure, where:

- **Model:** Responsible for image generation logic and management.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python), TensorFlow (machine learning library) - if needed for generation.
- **Database:** SQLite (for storing image data).

### Code Structure:

- *Directories/Files:* Separate files for generation logic, interface, and data management.
- *Coding Style:* Utilization of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Testing:** Verify the correctness of generation and personalization functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that components collaborate correctly.
- **User Interface Testing:** Check user interaction on different devices.
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluate the performance of image generation under various parameters.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, corrections, publication on user-accessible platforms.
- **Timelines:** Specify dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels with users for issue reporting.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Division of tasks into specific phases (e.g., implementation of the generator, interface, testing).
- **Timelines:** Determine the time needed for each stage.

## Cost Estimate:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours of work or a team of developers.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential fees for external services, technical support.
